# Math Ready

## Summary

The Math Ready project seeks to improve college graduation and retention rates by helping students to prepare for college mathematics placement exams.

## Scope

1. Within two years of high school graduation, 53 percent of the class of 2008 enrolled in a Minnesota public higher education institution.
2. Among those students who enrolled in public higher education, 40 percent took at least one developmental course.
3. Among those students who enrolled in two-year community or technical colleges, 53 percent took at least one developmental course.
4. Mathematics is by far the most common subject for remedial college courses. 32 percent of students in public higher education take at least one developmental course in mathematics.
4. The percentage of graduates who enroll in developmental courses continues to increase.

## Impact

1.	Students who lack proficiency in mathematics are excluded from the University of Minnesota and other four-year institutions in the MnSCU system.
2.	Remedial math students are unlikely to complete college-level mathematics courses.
3.	Students who take developmental courses earn lower grades. 17% of students who enrolled in developmental courses had a college grade point average below 2.0, compared with 9% of students who did not enroll in developmental courses.
4.	Fewer than one quarter of students who are referred to remedial courses in college will earn a post-secondary credential. 

## Proposed solution

Math Ready is an online learning community, consisting of the following components:
1. An open database of assessment items and other educational resources in mathematics, matched to specific topics listed in the syllabus for the College Board's ACCUPLACER exam, and accessible through a free API.
2. A website that utilizes responsive design to provide an optimal experience for users on any platform -- desktop, tablet, or smartphone.
3. A text messaging service (SMS) that delivers daily practice problems and periodic study reminders.
4. A web forum where students can ask and answer questions, form study groups, and connect with tutors.

Students who use the website will take a short diagnostic assessment. The website will generate a study plan for the student based on the results of the assessment. The site will contains links to videos and other instructional content, which will be vetted for accuracy and clarity. The site will also deliver practice problems in each content area, and give immediate feedback. Trusted users will be allowed to propose new assessment items.

Students can sign up to receive daily practice problems via text messaging. They do not need  an account on the website to utilize this service.

The ideal user of this tool is a high school senior who is planning to enroll in a two-year community or vocational college after graduating from high school, but recognizes that he/she has skill gaps in mathematics. However, the tool will be useful for anyone who needs to review pre-college mathematics.
